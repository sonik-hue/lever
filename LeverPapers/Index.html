            will ask the writer to complete an
            internal revision. Your writer will have
            an earlier deadline than the one you
            provided so internal revisions generally
            don't interfere with timely completion.

                                rate was over 5% and college
                                graduates were among the most
                                negatively impacted. Many of
                                these students graduated with
                                professional degrees and could
                                not find jobs. We wanted to
                                provide talented graduates with
                                a platform to use their skills

                                help pay off student loan debt.
                                In 2018, we expanded our
                                commitment to eliminate student
